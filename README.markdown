 Backbone.js Demo
=================

Overview
--------

This is a simple sinatra app for serving up a backbone.js single page
app. All of the styling is provided by twitter bootstrap. 

Backbone.js is a relatively small javascript library for organizing
javascript into an MVC architecture. Its only hard dependency is
Underscore.js, which provides some nice helpers like each and map
blocks.

Installation
------------

You will need Ruby installed on your machine.
From a command prompt, type the following commands:

*  _gem install bundler_ (Installs the bundler gem -- this is used to
   pull down all of the other gems needed for the sinatra application)
* _bundle_ (This will install all the necessary gem files to run the
  tests)
* _ruby application.rb_ (Invoke the ruby interpreter and start up the
  app with sinatra)
